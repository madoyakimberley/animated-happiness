        Paul Kagame was born on October 23, 1957, in Gitarama, Rwanda, into a
        Tutsi family. In 1959, following the Rwandan Revolution that targeted
        Tutsis, his family fled to Uganda, where he spent his childhood and
        youth in refugee camps. He attended schools in Uganda, including Ntare
        School and Old Kampala Secondary School, and later joined Yoweri
        Museveni’s National Resistance Army (NRA) in the 1970s, rising to a
        senior military role after helping overthrow Ugandan dictator Idi Amin
        in 1979

        In 1987, Kagame co-founded the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a movement
        aimed at ending the persecution of Tutsis and restoring their rights in
        Rwanda. He became the RPF’s military commander after the death of its
        initial leader, Fred Rwigyema, during the 1990 invasion of Rwanda. By
        1994, the RPF had defeated the Hutu-led government, ending the genocide
        against the Tutsi, in which an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 people were
        killed. Kagame was appointed Vice President and Minister of Defence
        under President Pasteur Bizimungu.
